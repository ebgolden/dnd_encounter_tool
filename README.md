# dnd_encounter_tool

This is a a tool for D&D Dungeon Masters who find it frustrating to keep track of initiative, character sheets, and music at the same time.

Includes
1. Parser that will pull information from some character sheets, depending on the format
1. Feature for manually entering character details when the parser won't work
1. Auto initiative rolling for NPCs (factors in bonus and handles ties)
1. Tracking for current turn in initiative
1. Built-in PDF viewer (icepdf)
1. Music dashboard for playlists to set the scene (only works with .wav format at the moment)
1. Saves everything to a csv file so it can be easily opened in excel
1. A lot of bugs, probably
1. Truly atrocious code which *barely* follows the MVVM pattern
1. Half-assed usage of lombok
1. Yeah...
